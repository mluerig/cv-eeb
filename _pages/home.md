title: International Forum for Computer Vision in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology
---

Computer vision, the automated extraction of meaningful information from images, is transforming data collection in many fields of science. We invite you to **Lund University from Sep 18th - 22nd 2023** to explore with us how computer vision can be used to break new ground in the fields of ecology and evolutionary biology.

We will bring together scientists from the domains of biology and computer sciences to interact in symposia, workshops, group discussions and social events and establish new communication and discussion formats across domains. Each symposium will feature keynote lectures from leading experts in the field ([see "Speakers"]({{site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/speakers/)), and shorter talks or posters presented by registered participants. There will be an extensive social component with many opportunities for exchange, discussions and networking.
