title: International Forum for Computer Vision in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology
---
Computer vision, the automated extraction of meaningful information from images, is is transforming data collection in many fields of science. We invite you to **Lund University from Sep 18th - 22nd 2023** to explore with us how computer vision can be used to break new ground in the fields of ecology and evolutionary biology.

The Forum will combine symposia, workshops, group discussions and social events to advance the use of computer vision among evolutionary ecologists and to promote networking and collaboration among participants ([see here for more details]({{site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/about/)). Participation is free of charge, but there will be a limit to the number of participants in the workshops, so please [register your attendance]({{site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/registration/) on this website. 

The event will take place from September 18th to 22nd 2023 at the Department of Biology at Lund University. [Visit this page to see how to get to the Ecology Building](https://www.biology.lu.se/contact/visit-us)
