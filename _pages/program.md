## Pub night

Due to the number of participants it was not possible to book a place for everyone, so here are suggestions for three pubs where participants could meet for a drink and interact. All of the pubs are in close proximity, and offer a pretty good menue with pub food classics, so they would be a good dinner option. The pubs are:

- Inferno - Paradisgatan 1, 223 50 Lund
- The Bishop's Arms - Sankt Petri kyrkogata 7, 222 21 Lund
- John Bull - Bantorget 2, 222 29 Lund
