Please register your participation in the forum using the form below. Note that attending **all Forum-related events is free of charge**, but we still ask you fill out the registration form so we can plan for the number of attendees. There is a limit of 25 participants to the workshops, after which we will put you on the waiting list (priority is given to students).
