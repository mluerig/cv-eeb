Please register your participation in the forum using the form below. Note that attending **all Forum-related events is free of charge**, but we still ask you fill out the registration form so we can plan for the number of attendees. 


Anyone, regardless whether you are student, postdoc or professor, can participate. However, to keep the workshops manageable and effective we set a limit of 35 participants to the workshops, after which we will put you on the waiting list (priority is given to students). **PLEASE SIGN UP UNTIL JUNE 15th**
