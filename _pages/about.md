Computer vision, the automated extraction of meaningful information from images or videos, is a blossoming field that has the potential to alleviate a longstanding bottleneck in the analysis of digital images. The increasing use of high throughput computer vision has already promoted scientific progress in various fields (e.g., medical research, agricultural sciences, or remote sensing). **The aim of this forum is to explore how computer vision can be used to break new ground in the fields of ecology and evolutionary biology, and to foster cross-domain collaborations.**

We will bring together scientists from the domains of biology and computer sciences to interact in symposia, workshops, group discussions and social events and establish new communication and discussion formats across domains. Each symposium will feature keynote lectures from leading experts in the field ([see "Speakers"]({{site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/speakers/)), and shorter talks or posters presented by registered participants ([see "Registration"]({{site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/registration/)). Moreover, participants will have the chance to learn how to implement computer vision projects through hands-on workshops led by experts ([see "Program"]({{site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/program/)). The Forum is accompanied by extensive social component with many opportunities for exchange, discussions and networking.

The event will take place from September 18th to 22nd 2023 at the Department of Biology at Lund University. [Visit this page to see how to get to the Ecology Building](https://www.biology.lu.se/contact/visit-us)
