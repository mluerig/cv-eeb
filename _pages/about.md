Computer vision, the automated extraction of meaningful information from images or videos, is a blossoming field that has the potential to alleviate a longstanding bottleneck in the analysis of digital images. The increasing use of high throughput computer vision has already promoted scientific progress in various fields (e.g., medical research, agricultural sciences, or remote sensing). **The aim of this forum is to explore how computer vision can be used to break new ground in the fields of ecology and evolutionary biology, and to foster cross-domain collaborations.**

### What

We will bring together scientists from the domains of biology and computer sciences to interact in symposia, workshops, group discussions and social events and establish new communication and discussion formats across domains. Each symposium will feature keynote lectures from leading experts in the field ([see "Speakers"]({{site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/speakers/)), and shorter talks or posters presented by registered participants ([see "Registration"]({{site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/registration/)). Moreover, participants will have the chance to learn how to implement computer vision projects through hands-on workshops led by experts ([see "Program"]({{site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/program/)). There will be an extensive social component with many opportunities for exchange, discussions and networking.

### When & where

The event will take place from Monday, September 18th to Friday, September 22nd 2023 on site at the Ecology Building at Lund University. There will be no hybrid / streaming option, but we will record the talks and host them on this website after the event has finished.
