### Background

Computer vision, the automated extraction of meaningful information from images or videos, is a blossoming field that has the potential to alleviate a longstanding bottleneck in the analysis of digital images. The increasing use of high throughput computer vision has already promoted scientific progress in various fields (e.g., medical research, agricultural sciences, or remote sensing). **The aim of this forum was to explore how computer vision can be used to break new ground in the fields of ecology and evolutionary biology, and to foster cross-domain collaborations.**
