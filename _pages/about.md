Computer vision, the automated extraction of meaningful information from images or videos, is a blossoming field that has the potential to alleviate a longstanding bottleneck in the analysis of digital images. We will cover various topics related to the application of computer vision in ecology and evolution, such as species identification, object detection, and tracking. You'll get a chance to present your work, participate in workshops, and discuss challenges and prospects with leading experts in the field. 

The Forum will combine symposia, workshops, group discussions and social events to advance the use of computer vision among evolutionary ecologists and to promote networking and collaboration among participants. We will bring together scientists from the domains of computer sciences and evolutionary ecology, who will present their research in symposia that are organized by different topical sessions (see Program). Each session will feature keynote lectures from leading experts in the field (see Speakers), and shorter talks given by registered participants (see Registration). Moreover, biologists will have the chance to gain practical experience with implementing computer vision projects through hands-on workshops led by experts (see Program).
